1. Loop through the customers returned from the search to get their IDs:

2. For each ID, call the update_customer tool to change their status to ""Lost"":

In order to pass this error back to the agent and have it try again, pass `handle_parsing_errors=True` to the AgentExecutor. This is the error: Could not parse LLM output:  Here are the next steps I will take:

1. Loop through the customers returned from the search:

```
for customer in customers:
```

2. For each customer, update their status to ""Lost"" using the update_customer tool:

```
  ""action"": ""customer_relationship_manager.update_customer"",
  ""action_input"": {
    ""customer_id"": customer[""customer_id""],
    ""field"": ""status"",
    ""new_value"": ""Lost""

```

3. Confirm the update was successful after each call.

Let's start executing this:

Action:
```
